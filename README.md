Basic Student Database utilizing security features

===================================================
CRUD Student Database Application

CRUD Student Database Application, from the name itself, is a simple web application with basic functions (CRUD operations - Create Read Update Delete). It runs like an enrollment system which has three levels of users: students, professors or educators, and the admins.

Set up your account using Registration and choose what kind of user are you. Are you a professor or a student? Then, fill up forms for your profile to complete your entry. If you already have an account, you can login immediately using your username and password. Note that there is no Admin user registration since if you are an admin, you are already in the system.

In this app, student users have basic actions they can take: view and edit their profile and choose a course. Professor users can do the same actions, only in addition, they can view the students enrolled in the course they also handle or take. Admins do not have profile but they have access to Student, Professor, Course, and Department List.
